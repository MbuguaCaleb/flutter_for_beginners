**Widgets**
```
They are a very important concept in flutter

Are the bedroack of a flutter application.

Everything in the entire flutter app is nested within the Root Widget

After the Root Widget we have the App Bar Widget which may have a text bar widget inside

Another type of widget is container widget.Which contains the widget tree

A widget Tree decribes the structure of widgets within your app.


We have a set of pre-built widgets within flutter.
These include:

(a)Text Widget

(b)Button Widget

(c)Row Widget

(d)Colum Widget

(e)Image widget


The Various flutter widgets contains different customizable properties that we can define values for.

For instance.

(a)Text widget. It has the following customizable properties including:Style,textAlign,Overflow,maxLines.

(b)Button widget. It contains properties like color,elevation,disabledColor and enabled


All widgets in flutter are also classes.Each widget has its own programatic class which defines its
behaviour and how it looks on the screen.

The language used in the implememtation of these classes is called dart.

Flutter uses dart as the programming Language to create apps
